Person entity identification and matching using face recognition and machine learning algorithms

#This project aims to demonstrate the potential difficulties of performing entity resolution and present an alternative way 
of solving the entity resolution problem of a semi-structured imbalanced dataset.

#It combines machine learning and deep learning techniques in order to enhance and contribute on solving the entity resolution
problem. Moreover, plethora of python libraries such as Fuzzywuzzy, Difflib, Urltools and Face recognition, have been employed,
individually or in combination, to achieve workâ€™s needs.
