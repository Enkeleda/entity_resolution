Person entity identification and matching using face recognition and machine learning algorithms

The vast and rapidly increasing quantity of structured and semi-structured data sets has caused the
Entity Resolution (ER) problem. The capability to extract and combine data from multiple sources
or duplicated records, in order to create a single resolved entity is essential in order to leverage
many aspects of the data. Indeed, several blocking techniques are typically employed to eliminate
the problem of ER. However, the heterogeneity of structure and semi-structured data, multi
dynamics, loose schema binding impose new challenges to the entity resolution and trigger the
scientific community to create more efficient techniques. In the scope of this thesis, entity
resolution problem and techniques are researched and studied upon, as well as software packages
and frameworks. Furthermore, several machine learning and deep learning techniques has been
implemented in order to extract knowledge from entities and provide an entity resolution solution
approach. In this sense, attribute-agnostic mechanism has been used to extract feature from the
values of entity profiles and assist on entity matching. Classification methods have been
implemented and evaluated in order to create an efficient and effective predicted model.
